# LinkShortener

Yet another link shortener... Except even worse.

This is just a quick project I slapped together in a couple of mornings. I wanted to utilize redis via Python and I wanted something homegrown for quick usage, I wasn't really interested in a lot of the other offerings out there that requires a ton of work to set up or overhead.

# Disclaimers

This is not even close to a secure product. This was just a morning project to fit my own home network usage. I am posting it here for fun and not serious usage.
